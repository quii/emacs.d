# my emacs config and notes

Based on https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure

## stuff i like so far

- Navigating files and buffers is a breeze
- Installing packages is as pleasant as sublime text
- Tab auto-completion like bash is nice

## wut?

I learn by writing things down.

## Commands as I learn them..

Notation for emacs commands is C for Ctrl and M is for Alt

`C-x C-s` saves the file (with this config you can also just do command+s like normal)

`C-z` quits

`C-g` Stops a command if you mess up

### Buffers

`C-x b` allows you to nav open buffers or create a new one if you specify an unknown name

`C-x k` will "kill" (delete) the buffer
